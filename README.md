# bday_reminder
This notebook creates a reminder for upcoming birthdays.

## Description
This notebook takes in user input for birthdays, then creates a reminder bubble for any birthdays coming in the next 2 months.

## Getting Started
To use this notebook, run the first 4 cells. Then the user can input new birthday information into cell 5 if necessary. From that point, the user can run the remaining cells.
### Dependencies
The following libraries are directly called in the project:
* datetime
* dateutil
* win10toast
* time

All other dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
## Next Steps
This project could be improved by adding the following functionality:
* Notifications for recently passed birthdays.
* Clickable elements in the notification, that allow status tracking for whether or not a present has been purchased.
* Translating the notebook into a package that allows the user to bulk add names and birthdays and maintain that memory.
